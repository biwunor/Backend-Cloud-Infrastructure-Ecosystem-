## Setup and Configuration

### Project Initialization

The Amplify project is initialized with environment-specific configurations:

- Development environment for ongoing development
- Staging environment for pre-production testing
- Production environment for the live application

### Authentication Configuration

Our authentication is configured with the following settings:

- Email and username-based sign-up and sign-in
- Password policies for enhanced security
- Admin-enabled user creation for managed accounts
- Multi-factor authentication (optional for users, required for admins)
- Custom verification messages

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "africaHelpApp": {
      "service": "Cognito",
      "providerPlugin": "awscloudformation",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "customAuth": false,
      "userPoolConfig": {
        "userPoolName": "africaHelpAppUserPool",
        "mfa": "OPTIONAL",
        "mfaTypes": ["SMS", "TOTP"],
        "passwordPolicy": {
          "minimumLength": 8,
          "requireLowercase": true,
          "requireUppercase": true,
          "requireNumbers": true,
          "requireSymbols": true
        },
        "signupAttributes": ["EMAIL", "NAME"],
        "requiredAttributes": ["EMAIL", "NAME"],
        "userpoolClientName": "africaHelpAppClient",
        "userpoolClientGenerateSecret": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL API Structure

Our GraphQL API is defined using the schema-first approach with the schema located at `amplify/backend/api/schema.graphql`. The schema defines:

- Data models with relationships
- Authorization rules for different user roles
- Custom resolvers for complex operations
- Subscriptions for real-time updates

Key entity types in our API include:

- `WasteItem`: Information about different waste types and disposal methods
- `Location`: Waste disposal locations with geographical information
- `User`: User profiles with authentication details
- `StatisticsSummary`: Aggregated waste management statistics

### Storage Implementation

The application uses two primary storage types via Amplify:

1. **S3 Storage Configuration**
   - Public bucket for shared resources
   - Private bucket for user-specific content
   - Authentication-based access control

2. **DynamoDB Tables**
   - Managed through Amplify storage resources
   - Auto-generated from GraphQL schema
   - Optimized with appropriate indexes

### Lambda Functions

The following Lambda functions are implemented:

- `wasteManagementFunction`: Processes waste data and generates statistics
- `imageProcessingFunction`: Analyzes and processes waste item images
- `notificationFunction`: Sends alerts and notifications to users
- `scheduledReportFunction`: Generates periodic reports

## Integration with Frontend

### Amplify Client Library Integration

The React frontend integrates with Amplify using:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth, API, Storage } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

### Authentication Flows

The application implements the following authentication flows:

1. **Sign Up Flow**
   - User registration with required fields
   - Verification via email
   - Initial profile setup

2. **Sign In Flow**
   - Email/username and password authentication
   - Optional MFA verification
   - Session management with token refresh

3. **Password Recovery**
   - Forgot password flow
   - Secure reset process
   - Verification requirements

### GraphQL Operations

The frontend interacts with the GraphQL API through:

1. **Queries**: Retrieving data with filtering and pagination
2. **Mutations**: Creating and updating data with optimistic UI updates
3. **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates for collaborative features

Example query implementation:

```javascript
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { getWasteItem, listWasteItems } from './graphql/queries';

// Query single item
const fetchWasteItem = async (id) => {
  try {
    const response = await API.graphql(
      graphqlOperation(getWasteItem, { id })
    );
    return response.data.getWasteItem;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching waste item:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Query with filtering
const fetchRecyclableItems = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await API.graphql(
      graphqlOperation(listWasteItems, {
        filter: { recyclable: { eq: true } }
      })
    );
    return response.data.listWasteItems.items;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching recyclable items:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Storage Operations

File operations in the frontend:

```javascript
import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';

// Upload file
const uploadImage = async (file, key) => {
  try {
    await Storage.put(key, file, {
      contentType: file.type,
      level: 'protected'
    });
    return `${key}`;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Get file
const getImage = async (key) => {
  try {
    const url = await Storage.get(key, { level: 'protected' });
    return url;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving file:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Configuration

The build process is defined in `amplify.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - amplifyPush --simple
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
test:
  phases:
    preTest:
      commands:
        - npm ci
        - npm install -g jest
    test:
      commands:
        - npm test
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: coverage
    files:
      - '**/*'
```

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment process follows this workflow:

1. Code is pushed to a branch in the repository
2. Amplify Console automatically detects the change
3. Backend resources are deployed (if changed)
4. Frontend application is built
5. Tests are run as part of the build process
6. Successful builds are deployed to the corresponding environment
7. Preview URL is generated for review

### Branch Mapping

- `main` branch → Production environment
- `develop` branch → Development environment
- Feature branches → Preview environments

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS
- S3 bucket contents are encrypted at rest
- User content is isolated through fine-grained access control
- Sensitive information is never exposed in client-side code

### Authentication Security

- User passwords are never stored in plaintext
- JWT tokens are used for session management with appropriate expiration
- Refresh tokens provide secure re-authentication
- User pool is configured with advanced security features

### Authorization Model

- GraphQL operations are protected by type-level and field-level authorization
- Access patterns follow least privilege principle
- Admin operations require elevated permissions
- Public operations are carefully restricted

## Monitoring and Debugging

### CloudWatch Integration

- Application logs are sent to CloudWatch Logs
- Custom metrics track key application events
- Alarms are configured for critical operational thresholds

### Amplify Console Monitoring

- Build and deployment history is tracked
- Access logs record console activity
- Real-time status monitoring for all environments

### Troubleshooting Tools

- Local development tools via Amplify CLI
- Mock data generation for testing
- Local Lambda function testing

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Configurations

- Development environments use minimal resources
- Production environment scales based on demand
- Lambda functions use appropriate memory allocation
- Storage lifecycle policies manage old content

### Estimated Costs

Monthly cost estimates for different environments:

| Service            | Development | Staging | Production |
|--------------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Amplify Hosting    | $0-5        | $5-15   | $20-50     |
| Cognito            | $0          | $0      | $0-55      |
| AppSync            | $0-5        | $5-15   | $20-100    |
| Lambda             | $0-5        | $5-15   | $20-100    |
| S3 Storage         | $0-5        | $5-15   | $10-50     |
| CloudFront         | $0-5        | $5-15   | $10-50     |
| **Total Estimate** | **$0-25**   | **$25-75** | **$80-405** |

*Note: Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns and scaling needs.*
